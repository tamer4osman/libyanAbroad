# Libyan Citizens Abroad - Roadmap

The purpose of this roadmap is to guide the development process of the Libyan Citizens Abroad system in a systematic, step-by-step manner. Each step is broken down into specific tasks, ensuring that best practices are followed along the way.

## **Phase 1: Initial Setup**

### 1. **Setup Repository and Project Structure**
   - [ ] Create a Git repository for the project.
   - [ ] Organize the project directory with subfolders for `frontend` and `backend`.
   - [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore sensitive files and directories (`node_modules`, `.env`, etc.).

### 2. **Setup Frontend with React & Vite**
   - [ ] Initialize the frontend using Vite:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm create vite@latest
     ```
   - [ ] Set up the file structure for React components, pages, and hooks.
   - [ ] Install necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install axios react-router-dom
     ```
   - [ ] Set up routing with `react-router-dom`.
   - [ ] Configure a basic homepage to test the setup.

### 3. **Setup Backend with Node.js & Express**
   - [ ] Initialize the backend using Node.js:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm init -y
     ```
   - [ ] Install necessary backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install express sequelize mysql2 dotenv
     ```
   - [ ] Create the basic file structure (`src`, `routes`, `controllers`).
   - [ ] Set up Express server and create a simple test route.
   - [ ] Test the route using Postman or `curl`.

## **Phase 2: Database & API Development**

### 4. **Design Database Schema**
   - [ ] Design the MySQL database schema to represent citizens, embassies, births, and deaths.
   - [ ] Define relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many relationship between embassy and citizens).
   - [ ] Create a database diagram for reference.

### 5. **Set Up Sequelize & Migrations**
   - [ ] Configure Sequelize for database interaction.
   - [ ] Create migration files for each table (`citizens`, `embassies`, `births`, `deaths`).
   - [ ] Set up models and associations in Sequelize.
   - [ ] Run migrations to create tables in MySQL.

### 6. **Develop RESTful API for Citizens**
   - [ ] Create routes and controllers for citizens (`/citizens`):
     - [ ] **GET /citizens**: Fetch all citizens.
     - [ ] **POST /citizens**: Register a new citizen.
     - [ ] **PUT /citizens/:id**: Update citizen details.
     - [ ] **DELETE /citizens/:id**: Remove citizen.
   - [ ] Test all endpoints using Postman or `curl`.

### 7. **Develop API for Embassies**
   - [ ] Create routes and controllers for embassies (`/embassies`):
     - [ ] **GET /embassies**: Fetch all embassies.
     - [ ] **POST /embassies**: Add a new embassy.
     - [ ] **PUT /embassies/:id**: Update embassy details.
     - [ ] **DELETE /embassies/:id**: Remove embassy.

### 8. **Births and Deaths Endpoints**
   - [ ] Create routes and controllers for births (`/births`) and deaths (`/deaths`).
   - [ ] Implement logic for recording new births and deaths for citizens.
   - [ ] Ensure proper relationships between citizens and embassies.

## **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

### 9. **Citizen Management UI**
   - [ ] Set up components for viewing, adding, updating, and deleting citizens.
   - [ ] Use `axios` to connect to backend API for citizen data.
   - [ ] Build forms with validation for adding/updating citizens.
   - [ ] Implement user-friendly notifications for success/failure responses.

### 10. **Embassy Management UI**
   - [ ] Create components for viewing, adding, and managing embassies.
   - [ ] Connect frontend to embassy API using `axios`.

### 11. **Handling Births and Deaths in UI**
   - [ ] Add UI components for recording new births and deaths.
   - [ ] Implement forms and lists to view and add birth/death records.
   - [ ] Ensure that new data properly reflects in the citizen records.

## **Phase 4: Authentication & Security**

### 12. **User Authentication**
   - [ ] Implement basic user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
   - [ ] Add middleware to protect sensitive routes.
   - [ ] Create login and logout components in the frontend.

### 13. **Secure Backend APIs**
   - [ ] Ensure API routes are protected using authentication middleware.
   - [ ] Use HTTPS in production for secure communication.

## **Phase 5: Docker & Deployment**

### 14. **Docker Setup**
   - [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for the backend and frontend.
   - [ ] Set up `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate frontend, backend, and MySQL.
   - [ ] Build and run the containers locally to ensure proper integration.

### 15. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (or another tool) for automated testing and deployment.
   - [ ] Automate the deployment to a cloud service (AWS, Heroku, etc.).

## **Phase 6: Testing & Optimization**

### 16. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Write unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
   - [ ] Use tools like `Jest` and `Supertest` for backend API testing.
   - [ ] Use `React Testing Library` for testing React components.

### 17. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize SQL queries and Sequelize associations for faster performance.
   - [ ] Ensure that the frontend is optimized for fast loading (code splitting, lazy loading).
   - [ ] Minify frontend assets for production builds.
