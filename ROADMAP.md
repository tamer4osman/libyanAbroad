# Libyan Citizens Abroad - Roadmap

The purpose of this roadmap is to guide the development process of the Libyan Citizens Abroad system using Next.js 15, which combines both frontend and backend in a single framework. Each step is broken down into specific tasks, ensuring that best practices are followed along the way.

## **Phase 1: Initial Setup**

### 1. **Setup Repository and Project Structure**
   - [ ] Create a Git repository for the project.
   - [ ] Initialize a new Next.js 15 project:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest
     ```
   - [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore sensitive files and directories (`.next`, `node_modules`, `.env`, etc.).

### 2. **Setup Next.js 15 Project**
   - [ ] Set up the file structure for components, pages, and API routes.
   - [ ] Install necessary dependencies:
   - [ ] Configure basic routing using Next.js file-based routing system.
   - [ ] Create a basic homepage to test the setup.

## **Phase 2: Database & API Development**

### 3. **Design Database Schema**
   - [ ] Design the database schema to represent citizens, embassies, births, and deaths.
   - [ ] Define relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many relationship between embassy and citizens).
   - [ ] Create a database diagram for reference.

### 4. **Set Up Prisma ORM**
   - [ ] Install Prisma:
     ```bash
     npm install prisma --save-dev
     ```
   - [ ] Initialize Prisma:
     ```bash
     npx prisma init
     ```
   - [ ] Define schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` for each model (`Citizen`, `Embassy`, `Birth`, `Death`).
   - [ ] Set up models and associations in Prisma schema.
   - [ ] Generate Prisma client and run migrations:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev
     ```

### 5. **Develop API Routes for Citizens**
   - [ ] Create API routes for citizens (`pages/api/citizens`):
     - [ ] **GET /api/citizens**: Fetch all citizens.
     - [ ] **POST /api/citizens**: Register a new citizen.
     - [ ] **PUT /api/citizens/[id]**: Update citizen details.
     - [ ] **DELETE /api/citizens/[id]**: Remove citizen.
   - [ ] Test all endpoints using Postman or `curl`.

### 6. **Develop API Routes for Embassies**
   - [ ] Create API routes for embassies (`pages/api/embassies`):
     - [ ] **GET /api/embassies**: Fetch all embassies.
     - [ ] **POST /api/embassies**: Add a new embassy.
     - [ ] **PUT /api/embassies/[id]**: Update embassy details.
     - [ ] **DELETE /api/embassies/[id]**: Remove embassy.

### 7. **Births and Deaths API Routes**
   - [ ] Create API routes for births (`pages/api/births`) and deaths (`pages/api/deaths`).
   - [ ] Implement logic for recording new births and deaths for citizens.
   - [ ] Ensure proper relationships between citizens and embassies.

## **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

### 8. **Citizen Management UI**
   - [ ] Set up components and pages for viewing, adding, updating, and deleting citizens.
   - [ ] Use Next.js `fetch` to connect to API routes for citizen data.
   - [ ] Build forms with validation for adding/updating citizens.
   - [ ] Implement user-friendly notifications for success/failure responses.

### 9. **Embassy Management UI**
   - [ ] Create components and pages for viewing, adding, and managing embassies.
   - [ ] Connect frontend to embassy API routes.

### 10. **Handling Births and Deaths in UI**
   - [ ] Add UI components for recording new births and deaths.
   - [ ] Implement forms and lists to view and add birth/death records.
   - [ ] Ensure that new data properly reflects in the citizen records.

## **Phase 4: Authentication & Security**

### 11. **User Authentication**
   - [ ] Implement user authentication using NextAuth.js.
   - [ ] Add middleware to protect sensitive routes and API endpoints.
   - [ ] Create login and logout components.

### 12. **Secure API Routes**
   - [ ] Ensure API routes are protected using authentication middleware.
   - [ ] Use HTTPS in production for secure communication.

## **Phase 5: Deployment**

### 13. **Deployment Setup**
   - [ ] Choose a deployment platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.).
   - [ ] Configure environment variables for production.
   - [ ] Set up a production database.

### 14. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (or another tool) for automated testing and deployment.
   - [ ] Automate the deployment process to the chosen platform.

## **Phase 6: Testing & Optimization**

### 15. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Write unit tests for components and API routes.
   - [ ] Use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend testing.
   - [ ] Implement API route testing.

### 16. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize database queries and Prisma operations for faster performance.
   - [ ] Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) where appropriate.
   - [ ] Optimize images and assets for faster loading.
   - [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance.
